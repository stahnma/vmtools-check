vmtools-check is a package that is designed to ensure your VMware-powered VMs 
have the lastest tools installed and configured for the currently running 
kernel.  Thus this package provides does the following.

exit 0 if you are not a VMware VM.
See if you have the latest VMwareTools package, if no install
See if the VMwareTools package is configured on the running kernel, if no, 
configure.

If you globally would like a new version of VMwareTools, simply add that 
package to your yum repository. Upon the next reboot (or somebody running this 
script manually), VMwareTools will be upgraded/installl and configured.

Requirements 
1.  This package is designed specifically for use on RHEL 5.  It may work on 
other yum-enabled systems.
2.  This package requires ruby. You'll already have ruby on the box if you're 
using puppet.  If you're not using puppet, there's a decent chance you're doing 
it wrong.

Let me know if you find any bugs.
